# Mad-Finager-With-Threading
An implementation of a File Management System that can create chunk, writes data onto the file using a self-created command interpreter. With the usage of threading, we can make the record of each event.
### A virtual file management system can perform following: 
##### 1. Create File 
##### 2. Delete File 
##### 3. Open File 
##### 4. Read File 
##### 5. Write File 
##### 6. Close File 

It represent its output and store its files in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file in a very beautiful manner.


# Motivation
Mostly we have seen many computers having the implementation of File Management System. So, creating, writing data or reading content from the file, or open a file is done by using a simple project called "Mad-Finager with threading."

# Build status
Previous version of this project is implemented as "Mad-Finager"


# Code style
We have used Python language by using its thread library, with the usage of JSON file structure.

# Technology Used
Python 3.7 and JSON

# Built with

PyCharm and Intelligaia IDE


# How to use?
First, we will give the name of the file in which we have written our all commands. Let's say it will be stored in cmd.txt. So, after running the code, then we will give the number of the threads by entering a numerical value.
Then it will started the all the  thread, and only one thread is currently being used and all other threads are locked until the execution of already executing thread. In the execution, we can perform the task of creating a file, opening of a file, reading the content from that file, writing data from the file, save changes to the file and then closing a file.

### Note
If we will enter '0' in the number of threads, it will terminate the program without executing it because no thread is in running state.
